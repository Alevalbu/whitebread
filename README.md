## 📋 Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), featuring modern web development practices and tools.

**Live Demo:** [https://whitebread.vercel.app/](https://whitebread.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)

```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## 🧪 Testing

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The application follows the Next.js App Router architecture:

- `app/` - Contains routes, layouts, and page components
- `app/page.tsx` - The main entry point (homepage)
- `public/` - Static assets like images and fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font family for Vercel.

## 🔧 Development Features
